# Next.js Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) boilerplate project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), enhanced with internationalization, theming, and a component library.

## Features

- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Next-intl for internationalization
- Next-themes for dark mode support
- Customizable UI components
- PWA support

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/[locale]/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
